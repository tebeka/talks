# Simulations for the Mathematically Challenged

Talk at PyWeb Israel on March 1, 2021
Talk at Code Maven on February 20, 2021

Question: What are the odds that in a class of 23 students, two have the same birthday?
We'll solve this question and others, using only a `for` loop and a random number generator.

In this talk, we'll see how to use Monte Carlo simulations to solve various problems that might intimidate you due to lack of match skills.
