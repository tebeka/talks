Title:
One Does Not Simply Iterator over Mordor

Description:

Tired of writing for loops look like it's 1995?  Go 1.23's Range Over Function is here to help! 
Join me for a journey from basic iterators to infinite streams, sprinkled with hard-earned wisdom from my years of wrestling with Python generators.
We'll explore Go's shiny new generic iterators, build some cool stuff, and learn how not to shoot yourself in the foot along the way.
Whether you're a Go veteran or just iterator-curious, you'll leave with practical patterns that'll make your code more elegant than a gopher in a tuxedo.

Outline:

- Iterators at large
- Range-over function
- Iterating over collections
- Pulling iterators
- Infinite streams: map, filer & reduce
