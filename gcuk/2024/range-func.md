# Range-over Function Iteration

Go 1.22 added "range-over function" iteration as an experimental feature.
In this talk, I'll start by explaining some iteration idioms such as separating iterators from containers and inversion of control.
Then we'll move to the experiment and see how you can use iter.Seq and iter.Seq2 with for loops.
Moving forward, we'll look at iter.Pull and iter.Pull2, see why they are needed and how you can use them.

Finally, we'll see how you can program with sequences and high order functions.
Yes, that's right - functional programming in Go.
