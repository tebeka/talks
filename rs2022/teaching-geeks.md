Lesson Learned from Teaching Geeks

# Description

Most of my time in the last eight years is spent on teaching geeks.
During this time I learned what works, what doesn't work.

In this talk, I'll talk about the lessons I learned:
- How to create appealing teaching materials?
- What makes an effective lesson?
- What makes students happy?

We'll also cover how can you as a student gain more from lessons and how teaching, even in small scale, will make you a better developer.
