## Title

Faster Pandas: Make Your Code Run Faster and Consume Less Memory

## Abstract (250 characters)

Code that runs faster and use less memory will save you money.
In this workshop you'll learn how to define performance goals, measure code performance, identify the problematic parts of your code and fix them.

## Description

Pandas is a great library, and most of the time it'll run fast enough for your needs.
However in some cases, you'd like your code to run faster and work with larger datasets.

We'll start by understanding the risks of optimization and how to set performance goals.
Then we'll see how to create realistic benchmarks and run them.
From there we'll move to finding out the problematic parts of your code and discuss various methods to improve them.
